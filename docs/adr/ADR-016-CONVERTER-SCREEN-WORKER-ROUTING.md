| **Anti-Chaos Rule** | None triggered — doc 10 §3 already establishes feature-detection-with-fallback as the sanctioned pattern for an unconditional-sounding Worker rule meeting a real browser capability gap (SharedArrayBuffer/COOP+COEP). This ADR applies that same pattern to Rule 01/02, it does not relax it. |
| **Tier** | Lightweight — additive decision, closes an explicitly-deferred open flag (ADR-014 point 6), no change to doc 10's Worker Pool architecture, Message-Based-only communication rule, or the Versioning mechanism (ADR-010). |

## Context

`ui/converter/converter-screen.tsx` (the first real Phase 9 screen) initially called
`core/parser/parse-and-validate.js` directly on the main thread. Doc 10 §1 states Rule 01/02
unconditionally — "Main Thread فقط برای UI" / "Parsing در Worker" — with no numeric threshold or
exception carved out anywhere in the document. Calling `parseAndValidate` from the UI thread is a
direct violation of Rule 02, not a gray area.

ADR-014 (the Build Step decision) explicitly deferred this exact question rather than inventing it
ahead of need: "the question of how a real browser `workerFactory` constructs a `Worker` from a
`file://`-served single HTML app is left open until the first Phase 9 screen actually wires a
Worker." The Converter Screen is that screen.

Mehdi's checkpoint feedback offered two literal options: (1) a Lightweight ADR defining and
justifying, with a real benchmark rather than an assumption, a numeric size threshold under which
main-thread parsing in the Converter Screen would be acceptable, or (2) actually moving the
screen's parsing onto a real Worker. Before picking either, the actual constraint was benchmarked
directly rather than assumed.

### Benchmark (real, not assumed)

A minimal classic-script and module-script Worker construction was run under Playwright/Chromium,
once from a `file://` URL and once served over `http://localhost`, with no artificial payload size
involved at all — the question being tested was *can a Worker be constructed*, not *how large an
input is too large*:

```
file://  + classic Worker  → throws synchronously:
  "Failed to construct 'Worker': Script at 'file:///.../worker.js' cannot be accessed from origin 'null'."
file://  + module Worker   → throws synchronously, same message.
http://  + classic Worker  → succeeds ("classic-worker-ok:pong").
http://  + module Worker   → succeeds ("module-worker-ok:pong").
```

This proves the real axis is **page origin / deployment mode**, not input size: `new Worker(...)`
fails identically for a 10-byte payload and a 10 MB payload under `file://`, and succeeds
identically for both once the page has an HTTP(S) origin. A byte-size threshold (Mehdi's literal
Option 1 phrasing) would therefore be measuring the wrong variable — it cannot fix a `file://`
failure no matter where the threshold is set, and it would needlessly route small HTTP-served
inputs through the main thread when a real Worker is already fully available there. Framing the
fix as **capability detection**, not **size thresholding**, is the correction this ADR makes to
the original framing.

## Decision

**Hybrid, resolving both of Mehdi's options at once**: parsing is routed through a real, dedicated
Worker by default — fully satisfying Rule 01/02 — and falls back to the existing main-thread
`parseAndValidate` only when constructing that Worker is physically impossible, which the benchmark
above shows happens in exactly one case: a `file://` page origin.

1. **`ui/store/parser-worker-client.ts`** (new) owns this routing decision. It is UI-layer, not
   Core (Rule 11 — constructing the right Worker URL needs the deployed page's own file layout,
   a UI/deployment concern), mirroring why `ADR-014` already put bundling concerns in `ui/`, not
   `core/`.
2. **Feature detection, not platform sniffing**: `createParserWorkerManager(WorkerCtor)` wraps the
   real `createWorkerManager({ workerFactory: () => new WorkerCtor(...) })` call in a single
   `try`/`catch`. `createWorkerManager` eagerly constructs its whole pool by calling
   `workerFactory()` once per pool slot at call time (already true of `core/worker/worker-manager.js`
   before this ADR), so the very first call already proves whether construction is possible at all
   — there is no separate "probe" step to keep in sync with the real dispatch path. On catch
   (the `file://` case, and the no-`Worker`-global case for non-browser/test environments), the
   manager is `null` and `parseRawConfigWith` falls back to calling `parseAndValidate` directly.
   This is exactly doc 10 §3's own pattern (`typeof SharedArrayBuffer !== 'undefined'` →
   `MessageChannel` fallback), applied to `typeof Worker` capability instead.
3. **No bundling/inlining trick is needed for the Worker script itself.** `core/worker/
   parser.worker.js` is loaded as a real `{ type: "module" }` Worker from a plain root-relative URL
   string (`"core/worker/parser.worker.js"`), the same convention `index.html` already uses for
   `<script src="assets/js/app.js">` — not `import.meta.url`-relative, since `scripts/build.js`
   bundles `ui/main.tsx` into a single classic IIFE (ADR-014) where `import.meta` does not survive.
   `parser.worker.js` needed zero code changes: `core/worker/shared/handler-envelope.js`'s
   `createWorkerEntry` already self-wires `self.onmessage`/`self.postMessage` whenever
   `self.postMessage` exists, i.e. automatically inside a real dedicated Worker context.
4. **The flattened wire result is unflattened back into a real, deep-frozen `UNMNode`** by the new
   `core/worker/unflatten-node.js` (the exact, lossless inverse of `parser.worker.js#flattenNode`),
   before reaching `parserStore` — `core/store/parser-state.js` and `core/store/selectors.js`
   expect the real nested UNM shape, not the Worker's flat wire format (ADR-003's flatten step is
   specifically for crossing the thread boundary; it does not leak past `ui/store/`).
5. **`parseRawConfigWith(manager, raw)`** is the actual dispatch logic, parameterized over the
   manager so both branches are deterministically unit-testable: `null` exercises the fallback path
   directly against `parseAndValidate`; a manager built from `tests/setup/worker-mock.js`'s
   `createMockWorkerFactory(handleParserJob)` (the same Worker Mock `tests/worker/parser-worker.
   test.js` already uses) exercises the real dispatch-through-a-worker-manager path end-to-end,
   including `CancelledError`/track-supersede behavior, without a real browser thread.
   `parseRawConfig(raw)` is a thin production wrapper over the module's real singleton manager,
   computed once from the real global `Worker` at module-load time.
6. **`core/worker/parser.worker.js` is bundled by `scripts/build.js` into `assets/js/parser-worker.js`
   before it can be loaded by a real Worker, in addition to (not instead of) staying a plain ESM
   source file Vitest runs directly.** This was found, not assumed: real-browser verification (this
   ADR's own benchmark methodology, applied a second time against the actual built app rather than a
   minimal repro) showed `new Worker("core/worker/parser.worker.js", { type: "module" })` constructs
   successfully under `http://` (proving point 2's feature detection above is correct) but the Worker
   never finishes loading — `registerClashParser` (one of the six parser registrations
   `parser.worker.js` imports eagerly) transitively imports the bare npm specifier `"js-yaml"`
   (`core/parser/clash/decode.js`, `core/converter/to-clash.js`), which a real Worker's module loader
   cannot resolve without a bundler or import map, unlike Node/Vitest's own resolver. The failure is
   silent from the page's perspective (a 404 inside the Worker's own module graph, no `pageerror`),
   so every Parse job dispatched to it hangs forever — this gap existed undetected until a real
   browser loaded the real, unbundled file, since every prior "real WorkerManager" test
   (`tests/worker/parser-worker.test.js`, `tests/worker/worker-manager.test.js`, and this ADR's own
   `tests/ui/store/parser-worker-client.test.js`) used `tests/setup/worker-mock.js`'s
   `createMockWorkerFactory`, which calls the handler function directly inside the already-loaded
   Vitest module graph and never triggers a fresh module-resolution fetch.
   `scripts/build.js` resolves this exactly the way it already resolves `preact` for `app.js`:
   bundling `core/worker/parser.worker.js` (format `"esm"`, matching the real
   `{ type: "module" }` Worker construction — unlike `app.js`'s classic-script `"iife"` format, a
   Worker has no `file://` CORS restriction on its own script tag to avoid, so there is no reason to
   avoid `type: "module"` there) into one self-contained ES module at `assets/js/parser-worker.js`,
   resolving `js-yaml` (which ships an ESM build via its `"module"` package.json field) and every
   other bare specifier at build time. `PARSER_WORKER_URL` in `ui/store/parser-worker-client.ts`
   points at this bundled path, not the raw `core/worker/` source. This is the exact question ADR-014
   Decision point 6 pre-authorized and deferred ("the question of how a real browser `workerFactory`
   constructs a `Worker` from a `file://`-served single HTML app is left open until the first Phase 9
   screen actually wires a Worker") — closed here as a packaging-step extension, not a fresh
   architectural fork: `core/`'s own source, `npm test`, and `npm run typecheck` are unchanged: only
   `scripts/build.js`'s output gains a second bundled artifact alongside `app.js`.

## Consequences

- **`assets/js/app.js` now exceeds `14-DEPENDENCY_POLICY` §2.1's "UI Layer" sub-budget (≤50KB gzip)
  by ~1KB — measured, not estimated**: real gzip of the built `app.js` is ~51.0KB (52206 bytes).
  Root cause, confirmed via an esbuild metafile: `js-yaml` (~92KB of pre-minify source, the single
  largest dependency in the bundle by far) is pulled into `app.js` by
  `core/converter/conversion.js` → `to-clash.js`, since the Converter Screen's "Clash YAML" export
  option calls `convertBatch` directly on the main thread, separately from the Parse-side `js-yaml`
  usage this ADR already isolated into `assets/js/parser-worker.js` (~38KB gzip) via
  `registerClashParser`. §2.1's own risk note named exactly this dependency ("YAML Parser") as a
  likely contributor to gradual bundle growth — this is that prediction materializing, not a new
  risk. The combined fetch weight across both artifacts (~51KB + ~38KB ≈ 89KB gzip) stays
  comfortably under §2.1's overall external-dependency ceiling (≤150KB gzip). Per Mehdi's review
  (2026-06-27): no immediate fix required; flagged here so the ~1KB overage on the UI-Layer
  sub-budget specifically is a recorded, approved fact rather than a future surprise. A real fix, if
  ever needed, would split `to-clash.js`'s `js-yaml`-dependent serialization into the existing
  (currently unwired) `core/worker/converter.worker.js` rather than touching this ADR's Parse-side
  Worker routing.
- **`file://` (Deployment Mode 1) is the only deployment mode where Rule 02 cannot be fully met**,
  and it cannot be met in *any* form there — there is no origin to grant a Worker script access to,
  regardless of approach (a 0-byte input would still fail). Falling back is the only available
  behavior in that mode, not a relaxation of the rule chosen for convenience.
- **HTTP(S)-served deployment (Deployment Mode 2+) gets a real Worker unconditionally**, satisfying
  Rule 01/02 exactly as written, for inputs of any size — no threshold exists to misconfigure or to
  need revisiting as input sizes grow.
- **`ui/converter/converter-screen.tsx`'s `handleParse` is now async**, awaiting
  `parseRawConfig(raw)`; a `CancelledError` (a superseded Parse click on the same
  `"converter-screen-parse"` track) is caught and silently ignored, never surfaced as a user-facing
  error — per doc 10 §6.1 ("Stale Jobs must never update State"), the same policy
  `core/worker/worker-manager.js` already enforces for every other Worker consumer.
- **No change to `core/worker/worker-manager.js`, `core/worker/parser.worker.js`'s own source, or
  doc 10's Pool formula/architecture** — this ADR only adds a UI-layer routing/fallback decision in
  front of already-existing, already-tested Core Worker infrastructure, plus a second bundling
  target in `scripts/build.js` (point 6 above). `core/`'s dev/test loop (`npm test`,
  `npm run typecheck`) still runs directly against `core/worker/parser.worker.js`'s raw source,
  unchanged.
- **`assets/js/parser-worker.js` (+ its `.map`) joins `assets/js/app.js` as a generated,
  `.gitignore`d build artifact** — produced by the same `npm run build` invocation, never
  hand-edited, never committed.
- **Re-verified against the actual built app in a real browser** (not just the minimal
  classic/module-Worker repro this ADR's Decision section benchmarks): both a plain URL config and
  a Clash YAML config (the specific input shape that exercises the `js-yaml`-dependent
  `registerClashParser` path point 6 fixes) were parsed through `index.html` under both `file://`
  and a real `http://` origin. `file://`: zero Workers spawned, zero console/page errors, correct
  parsed output (main-thread fallback engaged as designed). `http://`: 3 Workers spawned (matching
  pool size), zero console/page errors, correct parsed output for both inputs — including the Clash
  YAML case, proving the `js-yaml` bundling fix actually resolves the failure it targets, not just
  that the Worker constructs successfully.
- A future Phase 9 screen wiring the Analyzer or Converter Worker pools should reuse this exact
  pattern (`create<X>WorkerManager(WorkerCtor)` + try/catch + fallback, AND a matching
  `scripts/build.js` bundle target if that Worker's own import graph reaches a bare specifier)
  rather than re-deriving it, since the underlying capability gaps (`file://` origin; bare
  specifiers unresolvable inside a real Worker's module loader) are identical for every Worker kind,
  not specific to parsing.

## Addendum — Build output is committed, not `.gitignore`d (Critical Fix #1)

**Date:** 2026-06-28 | **Decider:** Mehdi

The "`assets/js/parser-worker.js` (+ its `.map`) joins `assets/js/app.js` as a generated,
`.gitignore`d build artifact ... never hand-edited, never committed" line above is corrected by the
same decision recorded in `ADR-014`'s own Addendum: Gitignoring the build output meant a plain
clone/ZIP-download of the repository opened `index.html` to a non-functional page, which directly
defeats doc 01's Offline-First goal and Deployment Mode 1. `assets/js/parser-worker.js` and
`assets/js/parser-worker.js.map` are now committed alongside `assets/js/app.js` — still only ever
written by `npm run build`, never hand-edited, but no longer excluded from the repository.

## Addendum — Converter Screen's Convert step now also routes through a real Worker

**Date:** 2026-06-28 | **Decider:** Mehdi

This ADR's Consequences section above says a real fix to the bundle-size overage "would split
`to-clash.js`'s `js-yaml`-dependent serialization into the existing **(currently unwired)**
`core/worker/converter.worker.js`". That parenthetical is now corrected: `core/worker/
converter.worker.js` is no longer unwired. It is wired to the Converter Screen's Convert step,
following this exact ADR's own pattern, and the resulting bundle-size effect was the opposite of
that paragraph's framing — see below.

What changed, reusing this ADR's pattern rather than re-deriving it (per the ADR's own closing
note above, "a future Phase 9 screen wiring the Analyzer or Converter Worker pools should reuse
this exact pattern"):

- **`ui/store/worker-feature-detection.ts` (new)**: the `typeof WorkerCtor !== "function"` guard +
  `createWorkerManager` try/catch body this ADR introduced in `parser-worker-client.ts` is now
  factored out into one shared `createDetectedWorkerManager(WorkerCtor, workerUrl)`, since the
  Converter Worker client needed the exact same logic, differing only in the Worker script URL.
  `parser-worker-client.ts`'s own `createParserWorkerManager` was refactored to delegate to this
  helper too — no behavior change there, same try/catch, same return type.
- **`ui/converter/converter-worker-client.ts` (new)**: mirrors `parser-worker-client.ts`'s
  Worker-first-with-`file://`-fallback structure (`create ConverterWorkerManager`,
  `convertBatchWith(manager, nodes, targetFormat)` parameterized for testing, `convertBatchInWorker`
  as the real-singleton wrapper, dispatched on its own `"converter-screen-convert"` track). Unlike
  the parser client, it needs **no flatten/unflatten step**: `core/worker/converter.worker.js`
  takes ordinary `UNMNode` objects and returns `convertBatch`'s own already-flat,
  already-structured-clone-safe `{ converted, skipped }` shape unchanged — confirmed directly from
  source, not assumed by analogy to the parser client. `convertBatchWith`'s Worker-routed-path test
  asserts the result `toEqual` the direct `convertBatch` output exactly (not modulo generated
  fields, unlike the parser client's `stableNode()`-stripped comparison), proving this.
- **`scripts/build.js` gains a third bundle target**, `assets/js/converter-worker.js` (+ `.map`),
  for the identical reason point 6 above bundles `parser.worker.js`: a real Worker fetches its
  script over HTTP(S) and cannot resolve the bare `"js-yaml"` specifier `core/converter/to-clash.js`
  imports. This was verified in a real browser before adding the build target, not assumed from the
  parser Worker's precedent alone: the raw unbundled `core/worker/converter.worker.js`, constructed
  as a real `{ type: "module" }` Worker, fires a real `Worker.onerror` plus a console 404 on the
  bare specifier; the bundled artifact responds correctly to a real conversion job.
- **`ui/converter/converter-screen.tsx`'s Output Panel is now async**: the previous synchronous
  `useMemo(() => convertBatch(nodes, format), [nodes, format])` is replaced with a `useState` +
  `useEffect` pair that calls `convertBatchInWorker(nodes, format)` and ignores a `CancelledError`
  from a superseded call (the same "Stale Jobs must never update State" policy, doc 10 §6.1, this
  ADR already applies to `handleParse`) — same pattern, same staleness discipline, now on both of
  this screen's Worker-routed steps.
- **`core/converter/`, `core/worker/converter.worker.js`'s own envelope/wiring, and
  `core/worker/worker-manager.js` are unchanged** — exactly as this ADR's own "no change to
  `core/worker/worker-manager.js`, `core/worker/parser.worker.js`'s own source" precedent for the
  Parse-side fix. Only a new UI/Client layer was added.

**Bundle-size correction:** the Consequences section above attributes `app.js`'s ~1KB
sub-budget overage to `core/converter/conversion.js` → `to-clash.js` pulling `js-yaml` into
`app.js` because "the Converter Screen's 'Clash YAML' export option calls `convertBatch` directly
on the main thread". That is no longer the path: the Converter Screen's Convert step now goes
through `assets/js/converter-worker.js`, not `app.js`, for the Worker-available case. `app.js`
still bundles `core/converter/conversion.js` (the `file://`-fallback code path still needs it
in-thread, and `ui/export/export-screen.tsx`'s own direct `core/exporter/` → `convertBatch` calls
are unaffected by this fix and remain main-thread by design, out of this ADR's scope), so the
`js-yaml` weight has not left `app.js` — this fix does not retroactively resolve the §2.1 overage
noted above, only adds a second, separate Worker-routed path for the common case.

**Real-browser E2E verification** (the actual Converter Screen UI, not an isolated Worker probe):
a real `vless://` URL was pasted into the Converter Screen's Input Panel, parsed, and converted to
Clash YAML through `index.html` under both origins. `http://`: the converter Worker actually
spawned and the Output Panel rendered correct Clash YAML. `file://`: zero Workers spawned for the
Convert step, main-thread fallback engaged, same correct Clash YAML output. A console 404
observed during the `http://` run was confirmed via direct CDP `Network.responseReceived`
inspection to be the browser's own automatic `favicon.ico` request — unrelated to the converter
Worker or its bundle, reproduced and ruled out, not a real defect.

**`core/exporter/` / Export Center is explicitly out of scope for this fix** and remains exactly
as before: `ui/export/export-screen.tsx` still calls `core/exporter/{to-txt,to-yaml,to-json,...}.js`
→ `convertBatch` directly on the main thread. That is a separate, unchanged code path — see the
correction this Addendum's date also applies to `README.md`'s Known Limitations section.
